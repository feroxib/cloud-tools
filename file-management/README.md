*smpdf*

Simple tool that finds all PDF file within the selected folder, downsizes them with reasonable ghostscript settings.
- Replaces spaces in names with underscores for naming simplicity
  - Have not implemented any other character replacements that might break the script
- Name the new compressed PDF with _small at the end of the file name.
