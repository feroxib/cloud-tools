# Cloud-tools
A small repository of scripts and tools I use for managing my personal cloud servers

Note: Most are only tested on my own cloud servers. Despite that, I tried to add some flexibility to them but have not had a chance to test most of them on multiple environments. Presented AS-IS. In each I will do my best to describe the limitations of the scripts/code and plans to imporove them. Any suggestions are welcome!

**Wireguard**
- set of tools to easily manage a wireguard server and automate simple tasks like adding profiles
